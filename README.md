# publishing_catalog

This is partially class project for the Udacity HTML-CSS and Javascript Basics courses,
and partially personal. I set up a webpage to function as a catalog of all musical compositions 
for strings. It uses a JS helper file which formats the data in the catalogBuilder.js for
rendering in HTML with CSS styling.
